An AI-powered meeting intelligence agent that can:

- Accurately capture meeting content from audio recordings from post-meeting recordings.

- Generate high-quality transcripts using a speech-to-text engine such as Whisper or equivalent. (If transcripts are already present, no need to extract transcripts again)

- Enable natural language interaction with the transcript—allowing users to query, summarize, or extract key insights conversationally.

- Persist and retrieve knowledge by indexing transcripts with vector databases (FAISS) to support contextual Q&A and long-term knowledge management.

- Integrate seamlessly with other AI agents and enterprise systems, ensuring the captured knowledge is reusable in broader workflows.


This AI Meeting Agent will have the following properties :

-Transcription & Enrichment: Convert speech to accurate text, semantic segmentation (topics, action items, decisions).

-Conversational Access: Provide natural language capabilities via Google Gemini, allowing queries like “Summarize all decisions from last week’s meeting” or “What were the blockers mentioned?”.

-Memory & Retrieval: Store transcripts as embeddings in FAISS/ChromaDB to enable contextual recall across multiple meetings.

-Integration-first Design: Create APIs (say Flask) and modular components for compatibility with other AI agents.
